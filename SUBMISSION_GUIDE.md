# Submission Guide

Welcome to AI List. This guide explains how to submit new AI products or update existing entries.

## Transparent Curation Process

We accept submissions through **GitHub Issues** to maintain a transparent curation process. This means:

- **Public Review**: All submissions are visible to the community
- **Open Discussion**: Anyone can comment on and review submissions
- **Community Input**: The community can help verify information and suggest improvements
- **Trackable History**: All changes and decisions are publicly documented
- **Quality Assurance**: Multiple eyes help ensure accuracy and completeness

This approach keeps the AI directory trustworthy, accurate, and community-driven.

## Adding a New Product

1. Create a free GitHub account (if you don't have one)
2. Go to [Create an Issue](https://github.com/spacesitenet/ailist/issues)
3. Click "New Issue"
4. Select the "Suggest a New AI Product" template
5. Fill out all required fields with accurate information

## Updating an Existing Product

1. Create a free GitHub account (if you don't have one)
2. Create a new issue with the title: `[Update] <Product Name>`
3. Describe what information needs to be updated
4. Provide the new/corrected information

## Making Pull Requests

If you would like to make a pull request to add a new product or update existing data:

1. Fork the repository
2. Make your changes to the product data files in `data/products/` (YAML format)
3. Run `bun run check` to validate your changes against the schema
4. Commit your changes
5. Submit your pull request

No build step is required — Hugo generates pages directly from the YAML data files at deploy time.

### Adding a product via CLI

You can also use the interactive CLI to add a new product:

```bash
bun run add
```

This will walk you through creating a YAML file for a product.

## Headquarters

The headquarters location is determined by where the company has the most headcount, not necessarily where it is legally incorporated.

## Open Source Products

If a product is open source (`open_source: true`), also provide:

- `license`: SPDX License Expression (e.g., `MIT`, `AGPL-3.0-only`). See https://spdx.org/licenses/ for the full list of identifiers.
- `source_code_url`: URL to the public source code repository (e.g., `https://github.com/org/repo`)

A product should only be marked as `open_source: true` if its source code is publicly available under an OSI-approved license.

## Compliance

If a product holds security or regulatory certifications, set the relevant fields to `true`:

- `soc2`: SOC 2 Type II certified
- `iso27001`: ISO/IEC 27001 certified
- `hipaa`: HIPAA compliant
- `cra`: EU Cyber Resilience Act compliant
- `fedramp`: FedRAMP authorized

All compliance fields default to `false` if not specified.
