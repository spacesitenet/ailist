## Tech Stack

- **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)** — Static site generator with Content Adapters
- **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)** — Package manager and TypeScript runtime
- **[Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)** — Utility-first CSS
- **[Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)** — Linting and formatting

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start dev server
bun run dev

# Build for production
hugo --minify
```

## Data

Product data lives as individual YAML files in `data/products/`. Each file is the single source of truth for one product. Hugo Content Adapters generate pages directly from these files — no preprocessing pipeline needed.

```bash
# Validate all product data
bun run check

# Add a new product interactively
bun run add
```

## Add a Product

See our **[Submission Guide](SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md)** for detailed instructions on how to add new products or update existing ones.

We accept submissions through GitHub Issues to maintain a transparent curation process.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions from developers experienced with Hugo to help enhance this project.

If you're not a programmer but have an idea or suggestion, feel free to create an issue and share your thoughts. We'd love to hear your feedback and consider it for future improvements!

## Fire OS Notes

For products supporting Android, we also include Fire OS compatibility. Since Fire OS is based on Android, most Android apps work seamlessly on Amazon Fire devices.
